      The lanternfly’s first recorded arrival in the United States is in the year 2014. 
      It arrived in Pennsylvania. I learn that the lanternfly isn’t even a fly, it is a plant hopper,
       more like a cicada than a beetle, moving in short hops and flights rather than long ones. On arrival, 
       it found a home in the ‘tree of heaven’, an invasive species itself, growing on disturbed soil on the 
       edges of highways and roads. One uninvited guest harboring another from the same continent.

      imagine its journey across sea and land. Perhaps a female lanternfly found a wooden box in
       an export yard in China, maybe a box of electronics, clothes, or plastic toys. She might have 
       found a small dark corner and laid her eggs on the woody surface protected from light and rain. 
       The box would pass through many hands, many machines, until it sat among a sea of boxes afloat on a ship. 
       The unborn nymphs would travel the enormous stretch of the Atlantic, stopping between islands and ports, to finally 
       arrive in Pennsylvania. I wonder what it was like for them to emerge in a city no lanternfly had seen before. 
       Which way did they turn first? What smell did they follow?

       Beast is a display typeface designed to serve as a drop cap at the beginning of paragraphs.
Inspired by the illustrated manuscripts of medieval bestiaries, it looks closely at small creatures
 no bigger than a human palm. The collection features the spotted lanternfly, the bay scallop, and 
 the delicate whirlybird seed. The typeface is built on Libre Baskerville by Impallari Type, whose 
 stems have been slightly narrowed and serifs gently rounded to create softer shapes that pair with 
 the lattice-like character of the Beast letterforms.
